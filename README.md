# MOO

A simple bulls and cows player with an intelligent solver, built in JavaScript.

Forked to work with 4 Digit Number (possible to start with 0) - Added some randomization/decision to make the AI feel more "unpredictable" and a general benchmark for measurement. At the moment solving at 6.24 turns average - would be a nice bot opponent.
