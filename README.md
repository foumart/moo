# MOO

A simple bulls and cows player with an intelligent solver, built in JavaScript. By Namanyay Goel [See the associated research paper](http://vixra.org/pdf/1601.0302v1.pdf)

Forked to work with 4 Digit Number (possible to start with 0) - Added some randomization to make the AI feel more "unpredictable" and a general benchmark for measurement. At the moment solving at around 6.5 turns average - would be a nice bot opponent.
